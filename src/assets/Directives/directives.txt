        1. Structural Directives :
                                It will change the appearance of DOM by adding / removing
                                1. *ngIf --> It will remove the total element from the DOM if the condition is false
                                2. ngSwitch --> 
                                3. *ngFor --> If we have list of elements then we can use this
        2. Attribute Directives :
                                Change the appearance / behavior of an html elements
                                1. ngClass
                                2. ngStyle
        3. Component / Custom Directives :
                                These are have their own templates




--> * symnbol is not mandatory for Structural Directives
--> <ng-template> use for calling based on condition. By using reference variable we can call this block
--> IF we have more data and lot of data then we have to use <ng-template> for each one like true block and else block
Syntax - *ngIF="check; then tBlock else eBlcok"

--> While writting ngSwitch, we have to write property binding like [ngSwitch]
--> We have to write * symbol for only cases i.e, *ngSwitchCase
--> We wont give value for *ngSwitchDefault

--> *ngFor --> if we want to iterate object, we must use pipe symbol with keyvalues like 
Syntax --> *ngFor="let x of emp | keyvalue"
