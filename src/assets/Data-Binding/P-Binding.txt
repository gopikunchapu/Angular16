Property Binding (.ts --> .html)
=================

1.  To set the property of an element in view to a property defined in the component's class.

Property Vs Attribute:
    1. Attributes and properties are not the same
    2. Attributes are defined by HTML
    3. Properties are defined by DOM
    4. Attribute values can not be change once they are initailized
    5. Property values can change


--> Boolean values are not work properly in interpollation
--> To over come above problem we have to use property Binding
