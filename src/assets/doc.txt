Till 13 v we will see construcor class by default 
from 14 v onwards we are not seeing constructor by default

16v 

A LifeCycle Hooks -->  total 8 
ngOninit interface --> till 15 by default 
from 16 its user choice wither you want it or not 

[(ngModel)] -->  Called Banana in the box

ngModel won't work with out import FormModules in angualr module file
For two way data binding won;t require reference name

--> <ng-template> use for calling based on condition. By using reference variable we can call this block
--> IF we have more data and lot of data then we have to use <ng-template> for each one 

Priciples :-
==========
    --> DRY - Do-not Repeat Yourself
    --> Data should resides at one place
    --> Hard coded data shoud not place in component class file. 
    --> For reusability code we have to use Dependency Injuction design pattren by using services

SERVICES :-
=========
    --> Services are used to send the data to all components means serves
    --> Till Angular 14v, after creating service file, we have to register service class name in root module file like below
            providers: [CourseService], in app.module.ts file
    --> So that every component will use this service
    --> But not required to mentioned like above because by default it is root like below
            @Injectable({
            providedIn: 'root'
            })
    --> But traditional formate is registering the all in root module only
    --> @Injectable means we have to inject this service class to use these service class methods/properties in constructor
    --> Till Angular 15v, if we create any component we can see Constructor by default.
    --> BUt from V16 onwords we are not getting. So that when ever it is required then only we have to write
    --> If property is declared with private then we can use/access that property with-in the class only
            Exampler:- private _propertyName; --> Use of Underscore is to identify the easily what type of that property is either public or private
    --> If property is declared with public then we can use this property outside of the class also.
    --> In Services also we can not provide raw / static data. The data must be reside some where else like in DB
            Example for Service should not having raw data like below
            getCourseInfo() {
                return [
                {id: 1, name: 'Angular', fee: 1500},
                {id: 2, name: 'Angular Material', fee: 1000},
                {id: 3, name: 'Bootstrap', fee: 500}
                ];
            }
    --> Service must be send HTTP Request like GET, Post, etc to get the data from DB by server as response
        Ex:- Course Name/Course Details  / etc component <--> Service <--> HTTP (GET, POST and etc) <--> Server Request / Server Response <--> DataBase 
    --> Here the response data is getting by server to service is called Observable
    --> By doing Subscribe the observable response in component from service

    OBSERVABLES :
    -------------
        --> An Observable is a sequence of items that arrive asynchronously overtime
        --> HTTP calls(request)<-->Single item <--> HTTP Response
        --> In Angular, an observable is HTTP response which arrives asynchronously
        --> But, that incomming HTTP response(observable) is not ready to use in our application
        --> So, after receiving the observable we need to convert the incoming response into an ARRAY
        --> After conversion into an ARRAY only it is ready to use in our application
    
    --> If we want use HTTP events we have to use HTTPClient class and it is in HTTPCleintModule.
    --> We have register HttpClientModule in imports array in-side of app.module.ts file
